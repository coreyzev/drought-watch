# drought-watch
The code behind [isthefuckingdroughtover.com](http://isthefuckingdroughtover.com)

Right now it's a simple HTML page just to have something up. But I want it to be more than that. 

Road map I need help with:

* Mock up more interesting data
* Making a dynamic back end
* Adding a clean version & programattically loading the proper version of the content w/ "lang" variables or something.
* Bring in data from other sources
  * NOAA charts comparing 1yr ago, 6mo ago, & today
  * Total precipitation over X amount of time VERSUS total needed in X amount to fix drought
  * Simple weather forcast?
* Get a CI build going
